The objective of this project is to design, develop, and implement an anti-riot drone 
equipped with autonomous features to enhance its effectiveness in handling crowd 
control situations. The drone should be capable of performing various tasks 
autonomously, such as monitoring and assessing the situation, dispersing non- 
lethal deterrents, and providing real-time data to the command center. The drone 
platform is based on a quadcopter model with a flight controller, a GPS, and a 
transmitter and receiver. The crowd detection module uses a machine lerning 
model to identify and estimate the density and distribution of the people in the 
scene. The delivery module uses a PID controller to optimize the flight path and 
speed of the drone and a dispenser to release the chocolates/Tear Gas 
capsules/Flowers at the desired location.
